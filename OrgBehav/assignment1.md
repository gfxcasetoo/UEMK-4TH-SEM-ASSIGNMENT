**4. What is the difference between a leader and a boss?**

A leader is someone who inspires and motivates others to work towards a common goal. Leaders use their vision, charisma, and communication skills to influence and guide their followers. A boss, on the other hand, has formal authority and is responsible for managing tasks and making decisions. While a leader may also have formal authority, the difference between a leader and a boss is that a leader focuses on inspiring and guiding, while a boss focuses on directing and controlling.
